# robot.subsystems

This packages exclusively contains the robot subsystems.

## Human Feedback Subsystems

A concept of human-feedback subsystems are introduced in the `robot.humanInterface.feedback` package. For those, it
usually makes more sense to package them under the `humanInterface.feedback` package instead of here. The one
exception is if the feedback device is physically located on the Robot (such as an LED light array); in that case,
it would make sense to package the subsystem here.
