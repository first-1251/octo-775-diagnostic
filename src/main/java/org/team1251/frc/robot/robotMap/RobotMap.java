 * This RobotMap is just a thin wrapper around the DeviceManager.  Use it to statically get port assignments.
 * For example to get the digital input/output port assigned to the BIG_SWITCH device:
 *
 *    RobotMap.deviceManager.getPort(org.team1251.frc.robot.robotMap.Devices.BIG_SWITCH, PortType.DIO)
 *
 * Don't forget to define your devices and set up their port assignments in the org.team1251.frc.robot.robotMap.Devices enum.
